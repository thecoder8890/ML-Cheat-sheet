# PCA(Principal Component Analysis)

It is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation that converts a set of correlated variables to a set of uncorrelated variables.

It tends to find the direction of maximum variation (spread) in data. PCA is more useful when dealing with 3 or higher-dimensional data.

PCA can be used for anomaly detection and outlier detection because they will not be part of the data as it would be considered noise by PCA.

Moreover, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is an unsupervised learning algorithm technique used to examine the interrelations among a set of variables.
